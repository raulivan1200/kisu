      <h1> ABOUT KISU </h1> 
       <h6>

A community-based creative agency.
kisu was founded in 2011 by two bass players with a mission to produce opportunities for talented individuals in their creative community. By recognizing and respecting each playerâ€™s unique talent, they fostered collaborations by bringing different creatives together to create something essentially new.

kisu is an independent creative agency born in Tokyo and growing up in London and New York. At kisu we value strength in diversity, bringing together people with different perspectives and an innate habit of seeing things differently. As a boutique agency, we are able to find solutions for local and international brands and strike fast in an increasingly complex world whilst creating collaborative opportunities for talent near and far.

From two Tokyo musicians, kisu is based over 3 continents with 30 full time employees from 11 nationalities/ 8 languages, and a creative community of over 1000 creative partners.
